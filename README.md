# Data_Structures
    🚀 A collection of efficient data structures implemented in Java. 
    
    📦 This library includes common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with different approaches to solve particular problems. 
    
        🔗 LinkedList: A linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next node.
        📚 Stack: A collection that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
        🚶 Queue: A collection that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
        🌳 BinaryTree: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
        🔗 Graph: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
